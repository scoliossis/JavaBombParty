# bomb party made in java (and not online ðŸ˜­)
## i dont know how to make online shit, so it stays as a solo game forever
### it works in both english and spanish, but there isnt a menu to switch language so u gotta change it in the code
### if you cant think of a word it tells you a possible word that you could have put
### also it shows the translation of the word into the opposite language to what you are playing on
### ^ this is added because i wanted to port the "notenoughspanish" module on og mushroom client to java
### the translation doesnt use and api it just reads the google translate page and gets the translation part
### you have 10 seconds between each word
