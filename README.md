# bomb party made in java (and not online ðŸ˜­)
### i dont know how to make online shit, so it stays as a solo game forever

#### it works in both english and spanish, but there isnt a menu to switch language so u gotta change it in the code
#### if you cant think of a word it tells you a possible word that you could have put
#### also it shows the translation of the word into the opposite language to what you are playing on
#### ^ this is added because i wanted to port the "notenoughspanish" module on og mushroom client to java
#### the translation doesnt use an api it just reads the google translate page and gets the translation part (same as notenoughspanish)
#### you have 10 seconds between each word
